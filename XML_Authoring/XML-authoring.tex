{
	\frametitle{What am I going to talk about?}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Document publication in web and print formats using XML
		as the base source.
		
		\item Used for many course documents:
		
		\begin{itemize}
		
			\item Currently INFO 321 and INFO 405
			
			\item INFO 212 is next

	\frametitle{But first, a word from our sponsors\ldots}
	
	\begin{description}
	
		\item[Chris Edwards] did the entire first implementation and
		much of the basic infrastructure for the second version.
	
		\item[Richard Pascoe] got me back into \LaTeX\ again, and also
		introduced it to Chris along with the idea of producing multiple
		output targets from the same source.
		
		\item[Richard O'Keefe] presented a seminar on using SGML for
		exam papers, which got Chris thinking about using XML for
		document production.
	
	\end{description}
}


\section[History]{The initial stages}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{What we wanted to do}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item All course documents in the same source format.
		
		\item Cross-platform (at least Win32 \& Mac OS X).
		
		\note{Cross-platform tends to imply (but doesn't mandate) open
		source tools.}
		
		\item Produce both print and HTML versions.
		
		\item Multiple versions of the same document:
		
		\begin{itemize}
		
			\item Questions for students
			
			\item Model answers for students
			
			\item Notes for teachers
			
			\item Individual documents vs.\ combined course handbook
		
		\end{itemize}
	
	\end{itemize}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{We used to use Word\ldots \\
		\normalfont\tiny (\(\rightarrow\) ca.\ 1998)}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item OK, but a typical Microsoft product.
		
		\note[item]{Supported hyperlinks, styles \& hidden text.}
		
		\item Print output typically pretty ugly; HTML even worse :(
		
		\item Messy for managing questions vs.\ answers vs.\ notes.
	
	\end{itemize}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{\ldots then we moved to \LaTeX\ldots \\
		\normalfont\tiny (ca.\ 1999--2002)}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item No GUI, but so what? It doesn't have that !\$@\%\^\$!
		paper clip.
		
		\item Beautiful print output.
		
		\item Web output mostly OK (\LaTeX{}2HTML), but still not ideal.
		
		\note{It was much better than Word! But there were many niggling
		issues, such as handling of images under certain circumstances.}
	
	\end{itemize}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{\ldots then Chris began to think about XML \\
		\normalfont\tiny (late 2002)}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Content-neutral format.
		
		\note{Different output formats vs.\ different views of the same
		document.}
		
		\item Potentially better HTML output using XSLT.
		
		\note{Or at least, more reliable HTML output.}
		
		\item We were starting to teach XML + XSLT anyway
		\(\Rightarrow\) good learning exercise!
	
	\end{itemize}

\frame
{
	\frametitle{\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{The first version of the framework \\
		\normalfont\tiny (S1 2003)}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Lab \& tutorial documents, INFO 321 2003.
		
		\item Two monolithic XSL style sheets: XML \(\rightarrow\) HTML,
		XML \(\rightarrow\) \LaTeX.
		
		\item Existing \LaTeX\ tool chain for print output (\LaTeX{}
		[\(\rightarrow\) DVI \(\rightarrow\) PS] \(\rightarrow\) PDF).

\frame
{
	\frametitle{But not all was well\ldots}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Not designed for general documents (i.e., other than labs
		or tutorials).
	
		\item Two separate style sheets \(\Rightarrow\) harder to
		maintain consistency.
	
	\end{itemize}
}


\section[Version 2]{The second version of our authoring framework}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{\parbox[t]{\textwidth}{The second version of the framework \\
		\normalfont\tiny (2004)}}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Single monolithic master format document combining both
		HTML and \LaTeX\ XSLT templates.
		
		\item Master format document processed through separate XSL
		master style sheets to produce XML \(\rightarrow\) HTML \&
		XML \(\rightarrow\) \LaTeX\ style sheets.
		
		\note{Nicely recursive---using a style sheet to generate style
		sheets!}
		
		\item Generalised to other types of documents.
	
	\end{itemize}
}

	\end{columns}
	
	\note{Everything to the right of the thick dashed grey line is part
	of the day-to-day workflow. The stuff on the left on occurs when the
	master format is changed.}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Features}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item The usual paragraph formatting, etc.
		
		\item Moderately complex tabular structures (including
		multi-column \& multi-row cells).
		
		\item Hyperlinks \& cross-references.
		
		\item Floating matter (figures, tables).
		
		\note{Figures and tables don't float in HTML.}
		
		\item Images in various formats.
		
		\item \emph{Very} basic maths.
		
		\item Conditional processing based on format (\LaTeX/HTML).
	
		\item Raw code for that \emph{really} crufty stuff.
		
		\item etc\ldots
		
	\end{itemize}
}


\frame
{
	\centering\Huge\alert{Examples}
	
	\note[item]{Show parts of format-master.xml and xml2xsl.xsl.}
	
	\note[item]{INFO 321 Analogy document (general document).}
	
	\note[item]{INFO 321 lab 3 is a good example of a lab document, with
	graphics, etc., plus it's embedded within the INFO 321 course
	handbook.}
	
	\note[item]{Do a clean build of the Analogy document and the
	handbook.}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{BUT WHAT ABOUT DOCBOOK?}
	
	\begin{onlyenv}<2>
	
		\centering All right, all right!!
	
	\end{onlyenv}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item<3-> DocBook is a set of comprehensive SGML \& XSL style
		sheets for producing technical computing documents from XML
		source, managed by OASIS. {\scriptsize (see
		\texttt{http://www.docbook.org/})}
		
		\item<3-> Why didn't we use it? \uncover<4->{\alert<4>{We didn't know about
		it!}}
		
		\note<4->[item]{Also, it was a useful learning exercise to find
		out how XML + XSLT worked.}
		
		\item<5-> Our framework is remarkably similar but not quite as
		powerful.
		
		\note{For example, their tabulars are much more powerful!}
		
		\item<5-> But we seem to do some things a little better :)
		
		\note<5->[item]{For example, handling of special characters. Our handling
		of hyperlinks also seems a bit more flexible and intuitive.}
		
		\item<5-> Use formatting objects to output direct to PDF.
		
	\end{itemize}
}


\section[Problems]{Problems encountered}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Problems encountered with version 2}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Sometimes need to be careful about white space.
		
		\note[item]{For example, tabulars that followed each other in
		the source and were intended to be separate paragraphs, ended up
		on the same line in the PDF because the white space between them
		got eaten by the transformation.}
		
		\item Sometimes things just don't work \(\Rightarrow\) embedded
		raw code.
		
		\item \LaTeX-only vs.\ HTML-only features can be a nuisance.
		
		\item Master format document needs to be modularised.
		
		\note[item]{Master format is currently about 2000 lines.}
		
	\end{itemize}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Platform issues}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Different \TeX\ distributions (fp\TeX\ vs.\ te\TeX).
		
		\note[item]{We now both use te\TeX.}
		
		\item Different XSLT processors (SAXON vs.\ Xalan-C vs.\
		Xalan-Java) with different command-line conventions.
		
		\note[item]{Solved the XSLT processor problem by defining an
		XSLT environment variable as appropriate on each machine, then
		defining a set of functions in our Makefiles to call the
		appropriate processor with the correct command line.}
		
		\item Line breaks!
		
		\note[item]{Line breaks pretty much resolved by storing
		everything in CVS.}
		
		\item Compatible vector drawing tools.
		
		\item Differing directory path conventions.
		
		\note[item]{Solved the path problem by using Cygwin on the Win32
		side.}
		
		\item Where to find the style sheets?
		
		\note[item]{Can resolve the style sheet location issue using
		either environment variables, symlinks or just copying the files
		into the local directory, but none of these are ideal. A nicer
		solution is to use the Apache XML-Commons resolver.}
	
	\end{itemize}
}


\section[Software]{What you need to do this yourself}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{The essential software}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item The XSL style sheets!
	
		\item XSLT processor (we use Apache Xalan or SAXON).
		
		\item A \TeX\ distribution (te\TeX).
		
		\item Something to edit XML with (GVim, BBEdit).
		
	\end{itemize}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Nice to have}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item GhostScript.
		
		\item GNU make.
		
		\item Vector drawing tool (Visio, OmniGraffle).
		
		\item Graphics manipulation tools (epstool, ImageMagick, \ldots).
		
		\item \LaTeX\ spelling checker (aspell, Excalibur).
		
		\item Version control (CVS).
		
		\note[item]{One nice feature of using CVS is that you can embed
		the CVS ID tags in the document so that you know which version
		of a document a student has.}
		
		\item Apache XML-Commons resolver for locating style sheets on
		the fly. {\scriptsize (see \texttt{http://xml.apache.org/commons/})}
		
		\note[item]{The resolver enables you to locate style sheets and
		DTDs on the fly using catalog files.}
	
	\end{itemize}
}


\section[Future]{Where to next?}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Did we achieve our goals?}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Cross-platform (Win32/Cygwin, Mac OS X, should work fine
		on any Unix derivative).
		
		\item \LaTeX\ gives high-quality print output.
		
		\item Good (and improving) HTML output.
		
		\item Customisable \& extensible.
		
		\item Sufficient geek factor :)
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{center}
	
		\uncover<2>{\Huge\alert{YES}}
	
	\end{center}
}


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Beyond the current version}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Roll out for INFO 212 (S2 2004).
		
		\item Investigate moving to DocBook (investigations in
		progress):
		
		\begin{itemize}
		
			\item Should be relatively easy to write an XSL style sheet
			to convert our markup to DocBook
			
			\item Need a customisation layer for ``our'' stuff
			
			\item Default PDF output too Word-like; also needs
			customisation (Apache FOP vs.\ Passive\TeX\ vs.\ ??)
			
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Find a good cross-platform vector drawing tool! PGF?
		Sodipodi? Skencil? Kivio? Others? (but \alert{not} XFig!!!)
		
		\item SVG for graphics?
		
		\item Lecture slides in XML?
		
		\note{I can see advantages to having the lecture slides in XML,
		as it's going to be a lot easier to produce an HTML version from
		an XML original than from the \LaTeX/Beamer files that I have
		now.}
