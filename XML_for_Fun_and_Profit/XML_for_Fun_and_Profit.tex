		\note[item]{Although this was the original intent, XML has
		developed into much more than this.}
		
		\item Intended for human consumption
		
		\note[item]{Being plain text, however, the temptation is there
		to make the markup human-readable. Handy for debugging, but
		technically unnecessary (and just makes things more verbose).}

	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Controversial
		
		\note[item]{\footnotesize Fabian Pascal argues fairly
		convincingly that XML databases are just a return to the
		hierarchical databases of old. XML is really better suited to
		storing \emph{document} structured data.}
		
		\item ``Structured'' vs.\ ``semi-structured'' vs.\
		``unstructured''
		
		\note[item]{\footnotesize These terms are rather badly misused.
		``Unstructured'', if interpreted literally, means ``random''.
		This is obviously not the case, however.}
		
		\item Relational: CLOB vs. ``shredding'' into relations
		
		\note[item]{\footnotesize Oracle provides XML support in the
		form of the XMLType data type, which is a specialised CLOB type.
		Shredding is usually only possible if there is an XML schema to
		describe the mapping; SQL Server provides native support for
		this. The ``big three'' all have similar XML support.}
		
		\item Non-relational: flat files vs.\ ``native'' XML database
		(eXist, Xindice, Tamino, \ldots)

		\item Document Object Model (DOM): XML-oriented API
		
		\note[item]{\footnotesize Note that the DOM is not a database
		API. It can just as easily be used to access plain XML documents
		(text files), and this is its most common use at present
		(Mozilla provides a DOM-based XML document browser in its
		sidebar). It is quite feasible however to provide a DOM wrapper
		to, say, a relational database, so that it looks like an XML
		data source to applications accessing it.}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\frame
{
	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item XML specs \& tools now sufficiently mature
		
		\note{A problem with a lot of the tools was that the specs were
		still being developed, and were therefore something of a moving
		target. Things have now stabilised sufficiently for real work to
		be done, but the tools are still lagging behind the standards
		(but that is fairly typical).}
		
		\item XML reached critical mass about a year ago?
		
		\item Web services a ``hot technology''
			
	\end{itemize}
}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\frame
{
	\frametitle{What's going to happen next?}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	
		\item Consolidation of existing specs and standards
		
		\item New versions of existing standards
		
		\note[item]{For example, a new version of XHTML that is a
		complete departure from XHTML 1.0, XSLT 2.0, etc.}
		
		\item Widespread adoption of interoperability standards such as
		ebXML
		
		\item Web services go mainstream
		
		\note[item]{It could be argued that web services already
		\emph{are} mainstream. We started teaching them this year.}
		
		\item New uses for XML keep emerging
		
		\note[item]{Water is one of the more unexpected uses of XML: an
		actual programming language using XML-like syntax!}
