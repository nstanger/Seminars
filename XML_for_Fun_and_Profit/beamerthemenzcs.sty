% Highlight a piece of text using the alert colour and also by drawing a
% frame around it. We need to ensure that the "unhighlighted" version is
% drawn in a box of the same height as the "highlighted" version. Thus the
% use of \boxheight, \boxdepth and \boxtotalheight to control things.
%
% We draw the "unhighlighted" version as is. We draw the "highlighted"
% version in a box of the same height by using \raisebox to make TeX think
% that the framed text is actually the same height as the original text
% (we don't raise the text at all).
%
% Since different texts will have different ascenders and descenders, we
% insert a strut to ensure that all the frames come out with the same total
% height.
%
% Note that the frame will always be drawn in the handout, but the alert
% colour won't.
