\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

In this workshop you will learn a little about using \LaTeX\ to produce
documents. We're really only going to scratch the surface of what's
possible, but the good news is that once you've mastered the basics,
it's not too difficult to expand your knowledge. A quick Google search
will reveal a huge amount of information about \LaTeX.


\subsection{What is it?}
\label{sec:what}

\LaTeX\ is a system for typesetting documents~\cite{UsersGuide}. It's
been widely available since 1985, and amazingly, files created then can
still be processed with the latest versions of \LaTeX\ (try doing that
with Word!). \LaTeX\ is actually built on top of another package called
\TeX. You could sort of think of \TeX\ as the ``machine code''
underlying \LaTeX\ (that's not really correct, but you get the idea).

\TeX\ is actually a \emph{macro language}, and \LaTeX\ is a large and
complex set of \TeX\ macros for formatting documents in various ways.
The source files are plain text with embedded markup. If you've ever
manually created web pages using HTML, you'll already be familiar with
the basic idea. In HTML you have tags that specify emphasised text,
headings and so on. \LaTeX\ provides commands that perform similar
functions, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:HTMLcomparison}.

\begin{figure}
	\hrule\medskip
	\textbf{HTML:}
\verbatiminput{HTMLExample.html}
	\bigskip
	
	\textbf{\LaTeX:}
\verbatiminput{LaTeXExample.tex}
	\hrule
	\caption{HTML vs. \LaTeX\ markup.}
	\label{fig:HTMLcomparison}
\end{figure}

One thing that always confuses people is how to pronounce ``\LaTeX''.
Technically speaking, the final ``X'' in the name is derived from the
Greek letter chi ($\chi$), so the ``correct'' pronunciation is a sort of
``cchhh'' sound (a bit like saying \emph{blecchhh})~\cite{TeXBook}.
Pronunciations in common usage include the obvious ``\emph{lay}-teks'',
but also ``\emph{lay}-tek'', ``\emph{lah}-tek'' and
``lah-\emph{tek}''~\cite{UsersGuide}. ``\emph{Lay}-tek''  and
``lah-\emph{tek}''are the most commonly accepted.


\subsection{But doesn't Word already do everything I need?}
\label{sec:Word}

Most people's initial reaction to \LaTeX\ is that it's a primitive
reversion to the Bad Old Days of command-line interfaces. Why should you
use something like \LaTeX\ when WYSIWYG word processors are so obviously
superior? There are several good reasons:

\begin{itemize}

	\item \LaTeX\ is designed from the ground up as a document
	typesetting system, and is particularly suited to creating large,
	complex documents (such as a thesis or book). The experience of many
	students within the department has been that once you get past about
	50 pages and have lots of figures, cross references and the like,
	Word begins to behave even more weirdly than it usually does. Word
	(and most other word processors) are really designed for small,
	simple documents, regardless of what Microsoft claims.

	\item The WYSIWYG features of word processing tools can actually get
	in the way of the writing process, because you are always tempted to
	fiddle with the formatting of the text as you write. \LaTeX\ forces
	you to write in plain text, which means that you focus on the
	primary activity: \emph{writing}. Appearance is really one of the
	last things that you should consider.

	\item \LaTeX\ automates a lot of the drudgery of constructing a
	document, so that you don't have to worry about it. Many rules of
	typesetting are built into \LaTeX\, and it automatically takes care
	of things like paragraph alignment and hyphenation (but you can
	always tweak them manually if necessary). Sections, figures and
	tables are automatically (and consistently!) numbered, and
	cross-references to these items are automatically updated when they
	are moved, no matter how big the document is (again, compare this
	with Word). Generating a table of contents is trivial, and
	generating a list of references or an index is relatively simple.

	\item \TeX\ (and by extension \LaTeX) incorporates all the rules of
	mathematical typesetting, so you can generate journal-quality
	equations with relative ease, e.g., \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} =
	\int_{0}^{1} f\)~\cite{UsersGuide}. Word's Equation Editor is
	reasonably good, but it can't match the range of symbols or quality
	of output that \LaTeX\ provides. All the major mathematical journals
	specify \TeX\ or \LaTeX\ for paper submissions (as do many other
	journals). If you're going to be doing equations, \TeX\ or \LaTeX\
	are really the only serious options. However, we'll skip the
	mathematical features in this document.

	\item Because \TeX\ is effectively a kind of programming language,
	you can do almost anything you want within the limits of the \TeX\
	engine. One particularly useful feature is that you can define your
	own macros, then use them again and again (very handy for repetitive
	stuff). If you later decide to change the output of the macro, you
	only have to change it in one place. There are also a huge number of
	extension packages for \TeX\ and \LaTeX\, handling everything from
	musical typesetting through to graphics manipulation. All of these
	are written in \TeX.
	
	\item It's very easy to produce all sorts of weird accented
	characters in \LaTeX~\cite{UsersGuide}: El se\~{n}or est\'{a} bien,
	gar\c{c}on. \'{E}l est\'{a} aqu\'{i}.
	\`{O}\'{o}\^{o}\"{o}\~{o}\={o}\.{o}\u{o}\v{o}\H{o}\t{oo}\c{o}\d{o}\b{o}.
	\LaTeX\ also generates correct ``quotation marks'' and apostrophes
	(none of this ``smart quotes'' rubbish), and also inserts ligatures
	where necessary (e.g., ``f{}i'' \(\rightarrow\) ``fi'', ``f{}f''
	\(\rightarrow\) ``ff'', etc.)

	\item A document produced by \LaTeX\ won't suddenly change it's
	formatting if you move it to another machine (as often happens with
	Word documents). In fact, as long as you haven't done anything
	really weird, you can process a document created in 1985 and it will
	come out looking identical to when it was originally written! \TeX\
	and \LaTeX\ are totally portable, because the documents are plain
	text and \TeX\ has been ported to almost every platform in
	existence. If you suddenly decide to switch to Linux, your \LaTeX\
	documents will come across without modification (except perhaps for
	changing DOS line breaks to Unix line breaks). Modern \TeX\
	distributions are fairly well standardised, so you can expect
	similar functionality on any platform. If you don't have a
	particular extension package, you can download it from any one of a
	large number of \TeX\ archive mirror sites~\cite{CTAN}.

\end{itemize}

The main disadvantage of \LaTeX\ (other than the initial learning curve)
is that you don't have quite as much freedom over choice of font, style,
etc., as you would in Word. Many would argue that this is a good thing!
\LaTeX\ comes with a default set of fonts known as Computer Modern
(which this document uses), but you can use PostScript fonts like
{\fontfamily{ptm}\selectfont Times} and {\fontfamily{phv}\selectfont
Helvetica} by loading an appropriate extension package. It can also
sometimes be tricky to ``break out'' of the defaults if you want to do
something unusual.


\subsection{\LaTeX\ tools}
\label{sec:tools}

There is a wide range of tools in the \LaTeX\ family. There is of course
\LaTeX\ itself, but there are several variants designed for specific
purposes. \PDFLaTeX\ is a variant that directly produces PDF documents
(\LaTeX\ normally produces something known as a \emph{device independent
file}, or \emph{.dvi}, which you then have to convert into something
like PostScript or PDF). Omega is a variant that supports Unicode, and
so on. Most likely you will end up using either plain \LaTeX\ or
\PDFLaTeX, depending on your needs.


\section{Using \LaTeX}
\label{sec:using}

Traditionally, \LaTeX\ is a command-line tool, but there are now many
graphical front ends. We have one called WinShell installed in the labs,
which is a front end to a \TeX\ distribution called fp\TeX. You should
find WinShell under \textsf{Start} \(\triangleright\) \textsf{Course
Specific Resources} \(\triangleright\) \textsf{Desktop Publishing}
\(\triangleright\) \textsf{Latex Editor}.

WinShell provides a syntax-colouring text editor, and point-and-click
access to all the major tools such as \LaTeX\ and \PDFLaTeX. There are
toolbars for the many symbols that you might want to use (such as arrows
or mathematical symbols), and you can also create your own specialised
buttons.


\subsection{A simple \LaTeX\ document}
\label{sec:simple}

All the sample files mentioned in this document can be downloaded from
the following URL:
\href{http://info-nts-12.otago.ac.nz/courses/latex/}{\textsf{http://info-nts-12.otago.ac.nz/courses/latex/}}.
You will also find in this directory a copy of this document and its
source.

\instruction{Download the file \textsf{small2e.tex} and open it with
WinShell.}

This is a simple document that shows you how to do some of the most
basic things in \LaTeX, like how to emphasise words and create sections.
Both it and its companion document (\textsf{sample2e.tex}) come standard
with most typical \TeX\ distributions.

\instruction{Click on the \PDFLaTeX\ button to generate a PDF
from this document.}

You'll see some messages go scrolling past at the bottom of the screen
as \LaTeX\ processes the file. Any errors that occur will also appear
here. The generated PDF should appear in the same directory as the
original file, along with several other support files (e.g., .aux, .log)
that are generated as a side effect of processing the original file.

\instruction{Open the PDF and compare the original with the result.}

Now let's go through the file in a little more detail. Notice the list
of prohibited characters on line 9 of the file. These characters have
special meanings in \LaTeX, so you can't just type them in normally. The
\% character starts a comment; anything between a \% and the end of the
line is ignored by \LaTeX. Line 37 shows you how to produce all but
three of the special characters. You'll find out how to produce the
remaining three in Section~\ref{sec:usefulstuff} below.

Line 11 tells you what type of document this is (in this case, an
article). The document class ifs effectively a document template that
sets up a whole collection of defaults, formats and commands. For
example, the \textsf{book} document class defines commands for chapters,
while the \textsf{letter} class doesn't have chapters, but defines
commands for specifying things like the address, the signature, and so
on. The standard document classes are \textsf{article}, \textsf{book},
\textsf{slides}, \textsf{letter} and \textsf{report}.

\instruction{Change the document class to \textsf{report} and see what
effect this has on the generated document.}

Most document classes also have a set of predefined options that you can
specify. For example, document classes usually default to a 10 point
font. You can change this to 12 point by saying
\verb+\documentclass[12pt]{article}+ (note that the only allowable
values for typical documents are \textsf{10pt}, \textsf{11pt} and
\textsf{12pt}). Other useful options include \textsf{a4paper} and
\textsf{twocolumn}, which do what you would expect.

\instruction{Try setting some of these options and see what happens.}

\verb+\documentclass{article}+ is an example of a \LaTeX\ command.
Commands are prefixed with a backslash (\verb+\+). The name of the
command is \verb+documentclass+, and its argument (enclosed by braces)
is \verb+article+. Looking further through the document, you'll see
several more examples of commands, such as \verb+\emph+ and
\verb+\textbf+. Most commands work similarly to these. Line 15 has an
example of a sectioning command: \verb+\section+. This defines a logical
section of the document. A subsection is defined on line 29.

Everything before the \verb+\begin{document}+ is known as the
\emph{preamble}. The main document body appears between the
\verb+\begin{document}+ and \verb+\end{document}+. In the simplest case,
you just type text into the editor. Extra white space within a paragraph
is ignored, and paragraphs are separated by one or more blank lines.

\instruction{Add some text to the file and see what happens.}

You'll notice that \LaTeX\ automatically handles hyphenation (as long as
your text is reasonably intelligible!) and formatting of the paragraphs.

Lines 21 and 22 show you how to produce correct opening and closing
quotes. Line 24 shows you how to produce a long dash---useful for pauses
in sentences. Lines 26 and 27 show you how to \emph{emphasise} and
\textbf{bold} text, respectively.


\subsubsection{Some other useful things}
\label{sec:usefulstuff}

\begin{itemize}

	\item \verb+-+ produces a hyphen, \verb+--+ produces a medium dash
	for number ranges (e.g., 15--25) and \verb+---+ produces a long
	dash---like this one.
	
	\item \verb+\ldots+ produces an ellipsis: \ldots
	
	\item \verb+~+ produces a non-breaking space.
	
	\item The special command \verb+\\+ inserts a line break, although
	there are some limits to where it can be used. Make sure you follow
	it with a space if you use it in the middle of a line, or \LaTeX\
	might interpret the following text as a command.
	
	\item To produce the three remaining special characters, use
	\verb+\(\backslash\)+ for \(\backslash\), \verb+\^{}+ for \^{} and
	\verb+\~{}+ for \~{}.
	
	\item You can emphasise text using \verb+\textit+ for italics.
	However, you're generally better to use \verb+\emph+ to emphasise
	text. The nice thing about \verb+\emph+ is that you can nest it, and
	the italics will turn on and off as required: \emph{Use italics to
	emphasise text, \emph{unless} you're already in italics}.
	
	\item \verb+\textsf+ produces \textsf{sans-serif text}, while
	\verb+\texttt+ produces \texttt{typewriter text} (which is
	monospaced and thus good for formatting code).
	
	\item Many commands require you to provide a length as an argument
	(e.g., \texttt{2cm}). \LaTeX\ is quite flexible in the units that it
	supports; it recognises points (\texttt{pt}), inches (\texttt{in}),
	centimetres (\texttt{cm}) and millimetres (\texttt{mm}), among
	others. Note that \texttt{pt} refers to \emph{true} points
	(\texttt{1in} = \texttt{72.27pt}); PostScript points are represented
	by \texttt{bp} (\texttt{1in} = \texttt{72bp}).
	
	\item \verb+\today+ will produce today's date. You have to be
	careful using commands like this in the middle of a sentence,
	however, because they ``eat'' any spaces that occur after them,
	e.g., \verb+\today is the day+ produces ``\today is the day''. This
	is just a peculiarity of the way the \TeX\ engine works. You can fix
	this by putting a backslash at the end of the command, i.e.,
	\verb+\today\ is the day+.
	
	On a related note, when \LaTeX\ sees a period (``.'') followed by
	whitespace, it assumes that this is the end of a sentence and
	automatically inserts a little more space to distinguish it from the
	normal inter-word spacing. However, this fails with things like
	``J.\ F.\ Smith''; \LaTeX\ interprets this as three different
	sentences, and consequently the spacing can sometimes look a bit
	weird. To avoid this, put a backslash after periods that don't end a
	sentence, i.e., \verb+J.\ F.\ Smith+, which produces ``J.\ F.\
	Smith'' (as opposed to ``J. F. Smith'').
	
	``\verb+\ +'' is actually a \TeX\ macro that inserts a normal
	inter-word space.
	
	\item Command names are case-sensitive (so \verb+\Today+ is
	different from \verb+\today+), and they can only contain letters; no
	numbers or unusual characters. (\TeX\ macro names can contain just
	about any character, but that's a whole other story.)
	
	\item You can create a title for your document, similar to that
	shown on page~\pageref{sec:intro} of this document. Use the commands
	\verb+\title+, \verb+\author+ and \verb+\date+ (defaults to
	\verb+\today+ if omitted) in the document preamble, then
	\verb+\maketitle+ in the document body, for example:
	\begin{verbatim}
\title{A boring paper}
\author{J.A. Dull}
\date{4 July 1993}
  ...
\maketitle
	\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\instruction{Try out a few of these to get a feel for how they work.}


\subsection{A more complex example}
\label{sec:complex}

\instruction{Download the file \textsf{sample2e.tex}, open it in
WinShell and process it with \PDFLaTeX.}

This file is a somewhat longer document that includes most of the
features discussed above, plus a few more. It's a good source of
examples of how to do most of the basics. We'll use it now to play
around with some more advanced aspects of \LaTeX.

We've already seen how commands work in \LaTeX. They're useful for
applying formatting to relatively small chunks of text. However, most
commands don't work across paragraphs, so what do we do if we want to
apply some formatting to an entire page of text? In addition to commands,
\LaTeX\ has things called \emph{environments} that work with chunks of
text of any size. Environments have a \verb+\begin+ command and an
\verb+\end+ command. You've already seen an example of this with
\verb+\begin{document}+ and \verb+\end{document}+. There are many
environments, including equivalents of the various text formatting
commands (e.g., an \textsf{em} environment that does the same as
\verb+\emph+), figures and tables, quotations, lists and so on. We'll
look at some of these now.


\subsubsection{Lists}
\label{sec:lists}

\LaTeX\ has three main list creation environments: \textsf{itemize} for
bullet-style lists, \textsf{enumerate} for numbered lists and
\textsf{description} for lists with text labels. They all follow the
same basic form, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:lists}. You can nest any
kind of list inside any other, and \LaTeX\ will take care of adjusting
the labels and indentation accordingly.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
		\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Input}}	&	\multicolumn{1}{c}{\textbf{Result}}	\\
		\hline
		\begin{minipage}{7cm}
			\begin{verbatim}

\begin{itemize}
  \item foo
  \item bar
  \item blah blah blah
\end{itemize}

			\end{verbatim}
		\end{minipage}
		&
		\begin{minipage}{7cm}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item foo
				\item bar
				\item blah blah blah
			\end{itemize}
		\end{minipage}
		\\
		\hline
		\begin{minipage}{7cm}
			\begin{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item foo
  \item bar
  \item blah blah blah
\end{enumerate}

			\end{verbatim}
		\end{minipage}
		&
		\begin{minipage}{7cm}
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item foo
				\item\label{baritem} bar
				\item blah blah blah
			\end{enumerate}
		\end{minipage}
		\\
		\hline
		\begin{minipage}{7cm}
			\begin{verbatim}

\begin{description}
  \item[Item 1] foo
  \item[Another item] bar
  \item[A very boring item] blah
       blah blah
\end{description}

			\end{verbatim}
		\end{minipage}
		&
		\begin{minipage}{7cm}
			\begin{description}
				\item[Item 1] foo
				\item[Another item] bar
				\item[A very boring item] blah blah blah
			\end{description}
		\end{minipage}
		\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Examples of list environments.}
	\label{tab:lists}
\end{table}

\instruction{The file \textsf{sample2e.tex} already contains an
\textsf{itemize} list. Try changing it into one of the other types of
list. Also try nesting lists inside others and see what happens
(\textsf{sample2e.tex} has an example of this).}


\subsubsection{Tabular layout}
\label{sec:tabular}

Often you will want to create some kind of tabular structure with text
or numbers aligned in columns (like Table~\ref{tab:lists}). This
is achieved using the \textsf{tabular} environment:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|}
  \hline
  \textbf{left column} & \textbf{centre column} & \textbf{right column} \\
  \hline\hline
  this is left aligned & this is centered       & this is right aligned \\
  use \verb+\hline+    & to produce             & horizontal lines \\
  \hline
  separate columns     & with \verb+&+          & don't miss any out! \\
  \hline
  end each row         & with a \verb+\\+       & including the last one\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{verbatim}


\newpage


\noindent This comes out looking like this:\bigskip

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|r|}
  \hline
  \textbf{left column}  &  \textbf{centre column}  &  \textbf{right column} \\
  \hline\hline
  this is left aligned  &  this is centered        &  this is right aligned \\
  use \verb+\hline+     &  to produce              &  horizontal lines \\
  \hline
  separate columns      &  with \verb+&+           &  and don't miss any out! \\
  \hline
  end each row          &  with a \verb+\\+        &  including the last one\\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\bigskip

\noindent \LaTeX\ automatically adjusts the sizes of the columns to fit
the text.


\subsubsection{Floating bodies: Figures and tables}
\label{sec:floats}

While you can have free-standing graphics and tables in a \LaTeX\
document (like the \textsf{tabular} example above), for academic writing
you will usually want to display them with a caption and a number so
that you can cross-reference them. \LaTeX\ provides two environments for
doing this: \textsf{figure} and \textsf{table}. \textsf{Figure} is
generally used for graphical material and \textsf{table} for tabular
material, but that's just by convention---\LaTeX\ doesn't really care.

All figures and tables are automatically numbered, and you can provide
an optional caption using the \verb+\caption+ command. Here's an example
of a very simple \textsf{figure}:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{figure}
  blah blah blah this is the figure body blah blah blah

  \caption{This is the very boring caption.}
  \label{fig:boring}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

The \textsf{figure} and \textsf{table} environments are examples of
\emph{floating bodies}. This is because \LaTeX\ intelligently figures
out the best location to place them based on various factors. In other
words, they ``float'' around the document as necessary. You've already
seen a couple of examples of these: see Figure~\ref{fig:HTMLcomparison}
on page~\pageref{fig:HTMLcomparison} and Table~\ref{tab:lists} on
page~\pageref{tab:lists}. Table~\ref{tab:lists} is a good example of the
floating aspect: in the source file, the table immediately follows the
text of Section~\ref{sec:lists}, but the in the final output the table
has floated to the top of page~\pageref{tab:lists}, and the main text
has automatically flowed itself around the table. We have some control
over this floating behaviour (and occasionally \LaTeX\ does get it
wrong), but it's usually safest to leave \LaTeX\ alone in this area.


\subsubsection{Cross-references}
\label{sec:xref}

One of the nicest features of \LaTeX\ is that you can attach a unique
label to anything that has a number associated with it (sections,
figures, list items, etc.), then create cross-references to that item
that are automatically kept up to date (for example, we can reference
item~\ref{baritem} of the \textsf{enumerate} list in
Table~\ref{tab:lists}). You create labels by placing a \verb+\label+
command immediately after the item that you want to label. For example,
the heading of this section looks like this:
\begin{verbatim}
\subsubsection{Cross-references}
\label{sec:xref}
\end{verbatim}
\verb+sec:xref+ is the name of the label attached to this section. Label
names are case-sensitive.

Once a label is defined, you can cross-reference the item using the
\verb+\ref+ command, e.g., \verb+\ref{sec:xref}+ will generate the
number for this section (\ref{sec:xref}). If you change the position of
this section in the document, the section number and all references to
it will update automatically the next time you process the document. You
may need to process the document twice to get it completely
right---\LaTeX\ will tell you if you need to do so. \LaTeX\ will also
warn you about any references it doesn't recognise or labels that have
been defined more than once.

Even better, you can get the page number for the item as well using
\verb+\pageref+, so the command \verb+\pageref{sec:xref}+ will generate
the page number that this section starts on (page~\pageref{sec:xref}).
It thus becomes very easy to generate cross references like ``see
Section~\ref{sec:xref} on page~\pageref{sec:xref}''.

\instruction{Try creating a few cross-references to items in
\textsf{sample2e.tex}, then move the labelled items around in the
document to see what happens.}


\subsubsection{Bibliographies}

\LaTeX\ also has very powerful bibliography building tools. If you
really want to do things properly, you should use \BibTeX, which is a
simple bibliographic database with tools that provide automatic
formatting of references. Using \BibTeX\ involves several extra steps,
however, so we'll only look at how to do it by hand.

The first thing you need to do is issue a \verb+\bibliographystyle+
command somewhere in your document body, e.g.,
\verb+\bibliographystyle{plain}+. Plain style is what this document
uses. There are many other styles available as extension packages; see
Section~\ref{sec:packages}.

Next, you need to create the bibliography itself using a
\textsf{thebibliography} environment. This is a variation on the
standard list environments, and looks something like this (this is
actually part of the bibliography for this document):
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{thebibliography}{99}

  \bibitem{TeXBook} D.\ E.\ Knuth (1986). \emph{The \TeX{}book},
  Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-13447-0. You only need this if you want
  to get into low-level stuff. Plain \TeX\ is very powerful, but not
  very easy to use!

  \bibitem{UsersGuide} L.\ Lamport (1994). \emph{\LaTeX: A Document
  Preparation System}, Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-52983-1. This is the
  primary reference for any \LaTeX\ system.
  
  ...
	
\end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}
The \verb+{99}+ argument to the \verb+\begin{thebibliography}+ specifies
the widest possible label that will occur in the bibliography.
Individual items are identified by the \verb+\bibitem+ command, which
takes a unique label name as an argument.

To cite a reference, use the \verb+\cite+ command, for example,
\verb+\cite{UsersGuide}+ (in this document) will produce the citation
``\cite{UsersGuide}''.


\section{Useful extension packages}
\label{sec:packages}

You can add new features to \LaTeX\ by loading a \emph{package} that
defines a new set of commands. There are literally thousands of
packages available, and most major \TeX\ distributions include many of
these by default. They are also available from the Comprehensive \TeX\
Archive Network (CTAN)~\cite{CTAN}, which is a worldwide network of
mirrored FTP sites for \TeX\ and \LaTeX. If you want something, it's
almost certainly on CTAN.

You can load a new package using the \verb+\usepackage+ command in the
document preamble, e.g., \verb+\usepackage{graphicx}+. Some of the more
useful \LaTeX\ packages are (in no particular order):
\begin{description}

	\item[\textsf{geometry}] It's surprisingly difficult to change the
	default margins in \LaTeX. You've probably already noticed that the
	default margins are quite large (or more accurately, the default
	text width is relatively small). This has to do with various
	typesetting and readability principles. The \textsf{geometry}
	package provides a flexible way of changing the margins of a
	document in quite complex ways, for example:
	\begin{verbatim}
\usepackage[a4paper,margin=1in]{geometry}
\usepackage[a4paper,left=2cm,right=3cm,vmargin=2cm]{geometry}
	\end{verbatim}
	
	\item[\textsf{graphicx}] This package lets you load in graphics in
	various formats and perform simple manipulations on them like
	scaling, rotating and cropping. Very useful for including those
	JPEGs that you want to use as a figure, or that Excel graph. Typical
	formats supported are EPS, JPEG, GIF, PNG and PDF, although this
	varies depending on which \LaTeX\ tool you're using (e.g.,
	\PDFLaTeX\ only supports PDF, PNG and JPEG). The main command
	provided by this packages is \verb+\includegraphics+.

	\item[\textsf{times}, \textsf{palatino}, etc.] These packages change
	the default font set from Computer Modern to something else. For
	example, the \textsf{times} package changes the main text font to
	{\fontfamily{ptm}\selectfont Times}, the sans-serif font to
	{\fontfamily{phv}\selectfont Helvetica} and the typewriter font to
	{\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont Courier}. The only problem with doing
	this is that maths mode still uses the Computer Modern fonts, which
	can look a little odd. The \textsf{mathptm} (Times) and
	\textsf{mathpazo} (Palatino) packages change the fonts for maths
	mode as well, so if your document includes a lot of maths, you might
	consider using one of these.
	
	If you just use the standard Computer Modern fonts, one ``gotcha''
	to look out for when producing PDFs is that you need to have Type 1
	versions of the Computer Modern fonts installed, otherwise the
	generated PDFs look terrible on-screen (they print fine, however).
	Most modern \TeX\ distributions should have these installed as
	standard, and will automatically use them if they are available.
	
	\item[\textsf{subfigure}] This package enables you to have captioned
	subfigures within a larger figure, so that you can then do something
	like ``see Figure~2.3(a)''.

	\item[\textsf{harvard}] With the \verb+[dcucite]+ option, this
	package provides a bibliography style that fits very well with Otago
	requirements for theses, e.g.: ``(Petersen 1996)''. it also provides
	handy commands like \verb+\possessivecite+, which lets you create
	citations like ``\ldots{}in Petersen's (1996) system\ldots''.
	
	\item[\textsf{verbatim}] \LaTeX\ already provides a built-in
	environment called \textsf{verbatim} that typesets its contents in a
	monospaced font and without any interpretation (so you can use all
	the weird characters that you would normally not be able to use).
	This can be very handy for typesetting code listings. However, the
	built-in \textsf{verbatim} environment isn't very flexible, so you
	might consider using the extended \textsf{verbatim} package, which
	adds features like the ability to read the verbatim text from an
	external file.

	\item[\textsf{lgrind} or \textsf{listings}] These are packages that
	let you include ``pretty-printed'' program source code listings
	(i.e., the keywords are highlighted, etc.). Each has its advantages
	and disadvantages; \textsf{listings} is a pure \TeX\ solution, while
	\textsf{lgrind} requires a separate pre-processor program.
	
	\item[\textsf{url}] URLs tend to contain all sorts of weird
	characters that have special meanings in \LaTeX\ (e.g., \~{}), which
	makes it difficult to include them in \LaTeX\ documents. This
	package provides the \verb+\url+ command that lets you avoid these
	problems. (The \textsf{harvard} package also supports URLs in
	bibliographic references.) Note that the \textsf{hyperref} package
	(see below) also handles URLs.
	
	\item[\textsf{hyperref}] This package gives you access to all sorts
	of clever PDF features, such as active hyperlinks (including URLs),
	bookmarks, etc. (see \cite{WebCompanion} for more information). For
	example, this document uses the \textsf{hyperref} package, and as a
	result all the URLs, citations and cross-references are actually
	live links (try it and see). Because this package redefines many of
	\LaTeX's internal macros, you should always load it last.

	\item[\textsf{beamer}] This package is designed as a replacement for
	presentation software like PowerPoint. It enables you to create and
	display professional-looking presentations using nothing more than
	\LaTeX\ and a PDF viewer.

\section{Where to go next}
\label{sec:next}

\begin{itemize}

	\item Do a Google search for ``latex tutorials''. You'll get
	thousands of hits!
	
	\item If you know what directory your \TeX\ directory stores its
	files in (often called \texttt{texmf}), try looking in
	\verb+<texmf>/doc/latex/base+.

	\item Buy a copy of Lamport's book~\cite{UsersGuide}, and preferably
	also \emph{The \LaTeX\ Companion}~\cite{Companion}.
	
	\item You'll find documentation for most packages buried somewhere
	in the \texttt{texmf} documentation tree (typically somewhere under
	\verb+<texmf>/doc/latex+).
	
	\item If you need to do complex graphics, you'll want a copy of
	\emph{The \LaTeX\ Graphics Companion}~\cite{Graphics}.

\end{itemize}
